# UofT | DSI - Team 16 Project: üîé Heart Failure Prediction


---

## üîç Research Question
**What demographic and health-related factors significantly predict the occurrence of heart failure in patients?**

---

## üéØ Project Overview
Heart disease is a serious health concern, and early detection is critical for better outcomes. In this project, we‚Äôre working with a dataset containing 11 clinical features to figure out which factors are most important in predicting heart disease. Our goal is to create a machine learning model that‚Äôs not only accurate but also easy to use, relying on basic patient information. This way, we can potentially eliminate the need for complex and invasive tests, making heart disease screening more accessible to everyone.

## üìä Dataset
**Dataset Source:** [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data)  
This dataset includes:
- **11 features**: 2 demographic and 9 health-related factors
- **Binary classification**: 1 (Heart Disease) or 0 (Normal)

# üîç Explanation of the Visualization

## üìä Distribution of Key Features by Heart Disease Status

This figure presents the **distribution of variables by heart disease status**, highlighting the differences between patients with and without heart disease. Each subplot visualizes the distribution of a key demographic or health-related variable using histograms and kernel density estimates (KDEs).  

---

## **Key Observations**

### **1. Sex**
- The majority of individuals with heart disease are **male (Sex = 1)**.  
- Women (Sex = 0) have a relatively lower representation among heart disease patients.  

### **2. Chest Pain Type**
- Patients with heart disease are more likely to have specific chest pain types (e.g., **Type 0 and 3**).  
- For **Type 2**, heart disease patients are significantly fewer compared to those without heart disease.  

### **3. Fasting Blood Sugar (FastingBS)**
- A higher percentage of patients with fasting blood sugar ‚â• 120 mg/dL (**FastingBS = 1**) are diagnosed with heart disease.  
- The majority of patients without heart disease have normal fasting blood sugar levels (**FastingBS = 0**).  

### **4. Resting Electrocardiographic Results (RestingECG)**
- RestingECG = 1 (ST-T wave abnormalities) is slightly more common among heart disease patients.  
- RestingECG = 0 (normal ECG) has a more balanced distribution between both groups.  

### **5. Exercise-Induced Angina**
- **ExerciseAngina = 1** (presence of angina during exercise) is strongly associated with heart disease.  
- **ExerciseAngina = 0** (no angina) is more prevalent in patients without heart disease.  

### **6. ST Slope**
- Patients with heart disease are more likely to have **ST_Slope = 0 or 1** (flat or downsloping ST segments).  
- **ST_Slope = 2** (upsloping) is more common in patients without heart disease.  

### **7. Age**
- Heart disease patients are generally older, with peaks around **50‚Äì60 years**.  
- Younger patients (below 50) are less likely to have heart disease.  

### **8. Resting Blood Pressure (RestingBP)**
- The distributions of RestingBP are similar for both groups, though heart disease patients show a slightly higher frequency at the higher range of blood pressure.  

### **9. Cholesterol**
- Cholesterol levels are widely distributed for both groups, with no strong separation.  
- Very high cholesterol levels (>300 mg/dL) are more frequent among patients without heart disease.  

### **10. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (MaxHR)**
- Heart disease patients tend to have lower maximum heart rates (**MaxHR < 140**).  
- Patients without heart disease often achieve higher heart rates (**MaxHR > 150**).  

### **11. ST Depression (Oldpeak)**
- Higher **Oldpeak** values (e.g., > 2) are strongly associated with heart disease.  
- Lower Oldpeak values are more common in individuals without heart disease.

### **Key Features of the Heatmap**
- **Purpose**: It shows the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of variables.  
- **Correlation Coefficients**:  
  - Values range from **-1 to +1**:  
    - **+1**: Perfect positive correlation (both variables increase together).  
    - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation (one increases while the other decreases).  
    - **0**: No linear relationship.  
  - **Color Scale**:  
    - **Red**: Strong positive correlation.  
    - **Blue**: Strong negative correlation.  
    - **White/Neutral**: Weak or no correlation.  
- **Focus**: The last row and column show the relationship of each variable with **HeartDisease**.



## üí° Key Takeaways for Heart Disease Prediction

The findings from the EDA analysis highlight the following factors as significant predictors of heart disease:

### **1. Demographic Factors**
- **Sex:** Men are at a notably higher risk compared to women.
- **Age:** The risk of heart disease peaks in individuals aged 50‚Äì60.

### **2. Health-Related Factors**
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (FastingBS):** Elevated blood sugar levels strongly correlate with diabetes and heart disease.
- **Chest Pain Type:** Certain types, like atypical angina, are strong indicators of heart disease.
- **Exercise-Induced Angina:** A critical symptom highly associated with heart disease.
- **Maximum Heart Rate (MaxHR):** Lower maximum heart rates are indicative of higher risk.
- **ST Segment Changes (Oldpeak & ST Slope):** Abnormal ST depression and slope values signal potential cardiac issues.

## **General Insights**
- **Sex, Chest Pain Type, Exercise Angina, ST Slope, and MaxHR** show clear distinctions between the two groups and are strong predictors of heart disease.  
- **Age** and **Oldpeak** also demonstrate meaningful trends, with higher age and ST depression levels associated with increased heart disease risk.  
- Some variables, like **RestingBP** and **Cholesterol**, show weaker separation and may not be as predictive.  

This visualization highlights the key factors that differentiate patients with and without heart disease, offering insights for targeted diagnosis and predictive modeling.
